## Thursday of graduation week: 
### Make 2 announcements:
1. Post a notice in the instructors-online-part-time-program channel:



2. Post something like the below example from Greg/A-Bronca in your cohort’s live question’s channel.  
Note: You can have graduates present in alphabetical order to make it easy on yourself.

Example:
“Hey fellow a/A grads! Just wanted to give you guys a heads up for what to expect tomorrow.
Each of you will have up to 5 minutes to showcase whatever you like on your capstone project! If time permits, I may ask questions like:

“What was challenging about this project”
“What advice do you have for students currently going through the program”
“What do you plan to add to this project next”
“If you could redo this project, what would you do differently”
Or some other question that someone may ask in Zoom

I was planning on going in alphabetical order for tomorrow's presentations.
For reference, the order of presentations will be:
LIST OF STUDENTS HERE

I'll remind you guys tomorrow, but if you are up next to present, send a request to your app so we don't have to wait for render to spin up.

Tomorrow's schedule:
12:00PM EST/ 9:00 PST - Moving forward talks with Trey (45 min)
12:45PM EST / 9:45PST - Graduation project presentations (45 min)
1:30PM EST/ 10:30PST - Final words (10 min)

You will all be able to have the rest of the day to yourselves after that, so feel free to make plans for lunch/dinner/drinks to enjoy your special day!
I will see you all tomorrow!”

Example from “2022-11-07-pt-questions” channel:



## On Graduation Day

Someone from Placements will present “Moving Forward” typically at the beginning of class.
This takes about 30 mins.
After the lecture, have students load up their projects, and get ready to present.
Budget about 5-10 mins per presentation depending on the Cohort Size.
Tell students that you will have to cut them off if they’re going long.  Consider telling them you’ll be giving a “1-minute” warning.
We’ll aim to finish the presentations before lunch.
After the Graduation Project Showcase students are free to leave for the day.


Graduation Project Showcase
Host will welcome graduates and guests and give any housekeeping rules
Remind all guests and attendants to remain muted during presentations unless they are actively presenting. Remind them any comments 
Host will read the name of the next presenter along with who is “on deck” in order to give them time to prep.
After each presentation, host provides some positive response either calling out specific feedback from the chat, asking them what they are excited about to add next, or asking to expand upon their process.
Once complete, congratulate and thank them and announce the next presenter.
At the end of the graduation showcase, congratulate the graduates and thank guests for helping to celebrate their accomplishments.
