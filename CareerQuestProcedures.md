Feedback:
Complete and provide feedback for Group Projects using the examples provided in the Google Drive folder.
Guide the students on how to implement the feedback effectively.
Student Expectations:
Clearly communicate to students that Capstone projects should not be started until the team project has been reviewed and marked “Greenlit (unverified)”.
Emphasize the importance of prioritizing team projects due to the difficulties of collaborative work post-graduation.
If you suspect students are not working on their Group Projects, and instead working on their capstones, check their Capstone repo for commits.  Then, issue a friendly warning message to the student, reiterating that the Group Project is the priority.
Project Eligibility for Greenlit (unverified):
Ensure students’ projects meet the following criteria before being considered Greenlit (unverified):
Four full CRUD, fully styled, and bug-free features with both front-end and back-end validations.
Three features for the Capstone project.
Adherence to CSS Project Requirements as listed in App Academy Open.
Scorecard has all Greenlit requirements marked “Yes”.
Validations for all interactive elements.
No default styling for all HTML elements.
Adequate padding/margin for elements.
Logical cursor properties for interactive elements.
Clear hover effects or descriptions for symbolic/icon elements.
A consistent and professional color scheme.
Below is an excellent example of additional considerations listed in detail:
