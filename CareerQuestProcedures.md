Greenlit (unverified):
Upon satisfactory completion of the checklist and project requirements, approve the project and update scorecards to “Greenlit (unverified).”
Document the greenlit status in the tracker and notify the student or team. 
A member of the placements team will be responsible for officially marking the project as “Greenlit” after graduation.
