# Career Quest Procedures Document:

## Goals

- To prepare students for the job market.
- Support and motivate students to polish their projects for the job search.
- Students should prioritize getting their group project to Greenlit status - post-capstone. 
- After the group project, polish their Capstones.

## Instructional Responsibilities

- Follow above Goals
- Provide support and feedback for Students while they work on their projects.
- Coordinate with the Placements team for lectures and assignments
- Track progress using the “greenlit” [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tf3H7xyNvFi3A6vIgZx7YtIDfUaeEI5Y0kpaixMrPGM/edit#gid=1515017928) (may be outdated)

## Procedure

### AI Week:

Review the PT Instructor Notes repo for a detailed breakdown of Week 45: Week 45 Structure.

### Other Weeks:

Someone from the Placements team will join you in class on most days for lecture and assigning material due dates.

On days with no assignments make sure students make progress on their group projects, then capstones.

## Collaborate with the Placements Team:

A member of the Placements team will come to class on most days and assign material for students consisting of items such as: Resume, Personal Pitch, Cover Letter, ect.
The Placements Team is responsible for communicating when these items are due.  Our job is to remind students of the due dates, and assist students with turning in assignments.
Students should “@” the Placements team member for final review, but we are able to offer our advice and feedback. 
“Hi <student_name>, I’m happy to review your resume, but we’ll ultimately defer to <placement_coach> for the final input.”
“Your resume looks good, but I think X, Y, and Z could be more concise, and are aligned with the readings on App Academy Open and what your placements coach mentioned during lecture.”
Progress Tracking:
Create a copy of the “greenlit” tracker and maintain it for your cohort: Greenlit Tracker Folder.
Document both team and individual student progress. Note any concerns or areas for improvement.
Students should be actively working on getting their team projects greenlit, or completing their Career Quest materials.
If students are clearly not working on their material, notify your Section Lead.  If we inform students that they need to have materials completed by “X” day, but they miss deadlines we can consider issuing strikes.  Furthermore, for serious cases of non-cooperation, we will escalate matters to Mark, Caleb, or Anna.
Feedback:
Complete and provide feedback for Group Projects using the examples provided in the Google Drive folder.
Guide the students on how to implement the feedback effectively.
Student Expectations:
Clearly communicate to students that Capstone projects should not be started until the team project has been reviewed and marked “Greenlit (unverified)”.
Emphasize the importance of prioritizing team projects due to the difficulties of collaborative work post-graduation.
If you suspect students are not working on their Group Projects, and instead working on their capstones, check their Capstone repo for commits.  Then, issue a friendly warning message to the student, reiterating that the Group Project is the priority.
Project Eligibility for Greenlit (unverified):
Ensure students’ projects meet the following criteria before being considered Greenlit (unverified):
Four full CRUD, fully styled, and bug-free features with both front-end and back-end validations.
Three features for the Capstone project.
Adherence to CSS Project Requirements as listed in App Academy Open.
Scorecard has all Greenlit requirements marked “Yes”.
Validations for all interactive elements.
No default styling for all HTML elements.
Adequate padding/margin for elements.
Logical cursor properties for interactive elements.
Clear hover effects or descriptions for symbolic/icon elements.
A consistent and professional color scheme.
Below is an excellent example of additional considerations listed in detail:
